my_memcpy(g_arr2, g_arr1, NBYTES)
rdi = g_arr2 = 0x7ffe1a33f010
rsi = g_arr1 = 0x7fff089f2010
rdx = NBYTES = 0xee6b2800

special implem depending on nbytes
check if rsi > rdi (to copy one way or another depending in case of overlap)

First load first 1024 non-aligned bytes

align memory correctly (on ????)
prefect before (???)
use 256b regs copy 4 at a time in a loop (1024bytes / iter)
Stop when all aligned bytes are copied
What is sfence ???
Then copy 1024 non-aligned bytes
What is veroupper ???
